The same is true for the Pacific Ocean.</li> </ul> <p>TIPS &amp; SHORTCUTS:</p> <ul> <li>When selecting cities, you can drag and drop a city to reorder the list using the icon to the left of the city name.</li> <li>To quickly enter multiple cities, you can type in three letter airport codes separated by spaces (e.g. &quot;LON HKG SYD LAX LON&quot;).</li> </ul> <p>If you prefer to begin your round-the world itinerary on a flight operated by Qatar Airways, please contact your travel agent, or, visit the following site:<br><br>Qatar Airlines: <a href=\"http://www.qatarairways.com/contactus\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.qatarairways.com/contactus</a></p>",
